# About Me

Hello! I'm Daniël, a software engineer with a passion for both architecture and programming. I love building solutions with C#, .NET, and Azure that not only work well today, but are built to last for the future.

## My Journey

I'm currently working as an **IT Consultant** at **Info Support** in Veenendaal (since November 2023), where I apply my software engineering skills across various client projects. My journey in tech began with a role as a **Programmer** at **Author-e** in Eindhoven (2020-2023), where I spent nearly three years honing my development skills.

I completed my **Bachelor of Applied Science in Informatica (Software Engineering)** at **Fontys Hogeschool Eindhoven** (2019-2023), and had the opportunity to do my graduation internship at Info Support, which led to my current position.

## My Approach

What drives me is the variety in software development – working across different domains and constantly learning something new while continuing to grow professionally. Quality is at the heart of everything I do, and I find great satisfaction in taking existing solutions and making them just that little bit better.

Through my work, I aim to contribute to a sustainable future by building software that is reliable, scalable, and designed for the long term.
